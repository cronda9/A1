Gracyn Kuerner & Christian Ronda A1

A paragraph describing your contribution, and another paragraph describing your teammate's contribution. 
Please be thorough; we're looking for two substantial paragraphs, not a sentence or two.

Gracyn:
In this assignment I contributed the parsing of the input from the command line
the use of textwrap and the overall formatting of the output to match with the 
output of the reference files. Additionally, I utilized the reference
python files gone over in class to generate the structure for the program
and tested both programs in comparison to the reference programs and 
dealt with error handling 

Christian:
In this assignment I contributed the structure of the SQLite3 statements
and formatted the printing of the program. Additionally, I managed
the pylint style errors, special character (%/_) use. and did some
corner case and boundary testing.

A description of whatever help (if any) you received from other people 
while doing the assignment, as prescribed by the course Policies web page.

We got help from Danqi Liao and Brianna (Bri) Butler in office hours.

A description of the sources of information that you used while doing the assignment.

We used the programs given in class like recovery.py and other programs 
from the lectures about python and database programming. Outside of 
class material used was the sqlite tutorial (https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/sqlite-like/) 
and sqlite.org 


An indication of how much time you spent doing the assignment.
10 hours

Your assessment of the assignment: Did it help you to learn? What did it
 help you to learn? Do you have any suggestions for improvement? Etc.

This assignment helped us learn a lot about SQLite and database
management. It was interesting to have a lack of specification for the
assignment aside from the reference programs making the construction of 
the program less structured then we were used to.
